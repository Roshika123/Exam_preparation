<h2>Most common C Programming Questions with answers</h2>
<hr>
<b>Q #1) What are the key features in the C programming language?</b><br><br>

<b>Answer:</b> Features are as follows:<br> <br>

Portability: It is a platform-independent language.<br>
Modularity: Possibility to break down large programs into small modules.<br>
Flexibility: The possibility of a programmer to control the language.<br>
Speed: C comes with support for system programming and hence it compiles and executes with high speed when compared with other high-level languages.<br>
Extensibility: Possibility to add new features by the programmer.<br>
</hr>

<hr>
<b>Q #2) What are the basic data types associated with C?</b><br><br>

<b>Answer:</b><br><br>

Int :Represent the number (integer)<br>
Float : Number with a fraction part.<br>
Double:  Double-precision floating-point value<br>
Char : Single character<br>
Void : Special purpose type without any value.<br>
</hr>

<hr>

<b>Q #3) What is the description for syntax errors?</b><br><br>

<b>Answer:</b> The mistakes/errors that occur while creating a program are called syntax errors. Misspelled commands or incorrect case commands, an incorrect number of parameters in calling method /function, data type mismatches can be identified as common examples for syntax errors.<br>
</hr>



<hr>

<b>Q #4) What is the process to create increment and decrement statement in C?</b><br><br>

<b>Answer:</b> There are two possible methods to perform this task.<br><br>

Use increment (++) and decrement (-) operator.<br>
Example When x=4, x++ returns 5 and x- returns 3.<br>

Use conventional (+) or (-) sign.<br>
Example When x=4, use x+1 to get 5 and x-1 to get 3.<br>

</hr>

<hr>

<b>Q #5) What are reserved words with a programming language?</b><br><br>

<b>Answer:</b> The words that are a part of the standard C language library are called reserved words. Those reserved words have special meaning and it is not possible to use them for any activity other than its intended functionality.<br>

Example: void, return int.<br>
</hr>

<hr>

<b>Q #6) What is the explanation for the dangling pointer in C?</b><br><br>

<b>Answer:</b> When there is a pointer pointing to a memory address of any variable, but after some time the variable was deleted from the memory location while keeping the pointer pointing to that location is known as a dangling pointer in C.<br>
</hr>

<hr>
<b>Q #7) Describe static function with its usage?</b><br><br>

<b>Answer:</b> A function, which has a function definition prefixed with a static keyword is defined as a static function. The static function should be called within the same source code.<br>
</hr>
<hr>
<b>Q #8) What is the difference between abs() and fabs() functions?</b><br><br>

<b>Answer:</b> Both functions are to retrieve absolute value. abs() is for integer values and fabs() is for floating type numbers. Prototype for abs() is under the library file < stdlib.h > and fabs() is under < math.h >.<br>
</hr>
<hr>
<b>Q #9) Describe Wild Pointers in C?</b><br><br>

<b>Answer:</b> Uninitialized pointers in the C code are known as Wild Pointers. They point to some arbitrary memory location and can cause bad program behavior or program crash.<br>
</hr>
<hr>
<b>Q #10) What is the difference between ++a and a++?</b><br><br>

<b>Answer:</b> "++a"  is called prefixed increment and the increment will happen first on a variable. 'a++' is called postfix increment and the increment happens after the value of a variable used for the operations.<br>
</hr>
<hr>
<b>Q #11) Describe the difference between = and == symbols in C programming?</b><br><br>

<b>Answer:</b> '==' is the comparison operator which is used to compare the value or expression on the left-hand side with the value or expression on the right-hand side.<br>

'=' is the assignment operator which is used to assign the value of the right-hand side to the variable on the left-hand side.<br>
</hr>
<hr>
<b>Q #12) What is the explanation for prototype function in C?</b><br><br>

<b>Answer:</b> Prototype function is a declaration of a function with the following information to the compiler.<br><br>

Name of the function.<br>
The return type of the function.<br>
Parameters list of the function.<br>
prototype function in C<br>

<b>int Sum(int,int);</b><br>
In this example Name of the function is Sum, the return type is the integer data type and it accepts two integer parameters.<br>

</hr>

<hr>
<b>Q #13) What is the explanation for the cyclic nature of data types in C?</b><br><br>

<b>Answer:</b> Some of the data types in C have special characteristic nature when a developer assigns value beyond the range of the data type. There will be no compiler error and the value changes according to a cyclic order. This is called cyclic nature. Char, int, long int data types have this property. Further float, double and long double data types do not have this property.<br>
</hr>

<hr>
<b>Q #14) Describe the header file and its usage in C programming?</b><br><br>

<b>Answer:</b> The file containing the definitions and prototypes of the functions being used in the program are called a header file. It is also known as a library file.<br>

Example: The header file contains commands like printf and scanf is from the stdio.h library file.<br>
</hr>
<hr>
<b>Q #15) There is a practice in coding to keep some code blocks in comment symbols than delete it when debugging. How this affects when debugging?</b><br><br>

<b>Answer:</b> This concept is called commenting out and this is the way to isolate some part of the code which scans possible reason for the error. Also, this concept helps to save time because if the code is not the reason for the issue it can simply be removed from comment.<br>
</hr>
<hr>
<b>Q #16) What is a nested loop?</b><br><br>

<b>Answer:</b> A loop that runs within another loop is referred to as a nested loop. The first loop is called the Outer Loop and the inside loop is called the Inner Loop. The inner loop executes the number of times defined in an outer loop.<br>
</hr>
<hr>
<b>Q #17) What is the general form of function in C?</b><br><br>

<b>Answer:</b> The function definition in C contains four main sections.<br><br>

return_type function_name( parameter list )<br>
{ <br>
      body of the function<br>
}<br>
Return Type: Data type of the return value of the function.<br>
Function Name: The name of the function and it is important to have a meaningful name that describes the activity of the function.<br>
Parameters: The input values for the function that are used to perform the required action.<br>
Function Body: Collection of statements that performs the required action.<br>
</hr>

<hr>
<b>Q #18) What is the behavioral difference when the header file is included in double-quotes ("") and angular braces (<>)?</b><br><br>

<b>Answer:</b> When the Header file is included within double quotes (" "), compiler search first in the working directory for the particular header file. If not found, then it searches the file in the include path. But when the Header file is included within angular braces (<>), the compiler only searches in the working directory for the particular header file.<br>

<b>Q #19) What is the correct code to have the following output in C using nested for loop?</b><br>

<b>1</b><br>
<b>12</b><br>
<b>123</b><br>
<b>1234</b><br>
<b>12345</b><br><br>
<b>Answer:</b><br><br>

#include <stdio.h><br><br>
 
int main () {<br><br>
 
     int a;<br>
     int b;<br>
     /* for loop execution */<br>
     for( a = 1; a < 6; a++ )<br>
     {<br>
           /* for loop execution */<br>
           for ( b = 1; b <= a; b++ )<br>
           {<br>
                 printf("%d",b);<br>
            }<br>
            printf("\n");<br>
     }<br><br>
 
     return 0;<br>
}<br>

<b>Q #20) What are the modifiers available in C programming language?</b><br><br>

<b>Answer:</b> There are 5 modifiers available in the C programming language as follows:<br><br>

Short<br>
Long<br>
Signed<br>
Unsigned<br>
long long<br>
</hr>

<b>Q #21) What is the process to generate random numbers in C programming language?</b><br><br>

<b>Answer:</b> The command rand() is available to use for this purpose. The function returns an integer number beginning from zero(0). The following sample code demonstrates the use of rand().<br><br>

Code:<br><br>

#include <stdio.h><br>
#include <stdlib.h><br><br>
 
int main ()<br>
{<br>
int a;<br>
int b;<br><br>
 
    for(a=1; a<11; a++)<br>
   {<br>
        b = rand();<br>
        printf( "%d\n", b );<br>
    }<br>
      return 0;<br>
}<br> <br>

<b>Output</b><br>
<b>1804289383</b><br>
<b>846930886</b><br>
<b>1681692777</b><br>
<b>1714636915</b><br>

<b>Q #22) What is the explanation for modular programming?</b><br><br>

<b>Answer:</b> The process of dividing the main program into executable subsection is called module programming. This concept promotes reusability.<br>
